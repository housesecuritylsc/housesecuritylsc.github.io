<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
