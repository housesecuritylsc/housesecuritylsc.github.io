<p>Increase safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. At $24.99 per month, SimpliSafe's top-tier package is still very cost effective compared to the other companies on this list. It's virtually a steal. The Interactive package adds more control to the SimpliSafe system with mobile access and both text and e-mail notices.

<p>A system that needs a contract may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems normally don't included in advance charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>

<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which could be an inexpensive alternative for consumers in rural areas. We advise cellular systems since they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is the one of the very best tools for supervising your home. Its wire-free design, high-resolution video, and affordable cloud monitoring assist it stand above the competition.
