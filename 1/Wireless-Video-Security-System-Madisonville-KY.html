<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we don't think that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>
