<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, signals, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for instance, are compatible with the IP cameras only from specific manufacturers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you should initially make sure that the device will work with the cameras you've purchased. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras ought to have the ability to offer you with the necessary information.</p>
