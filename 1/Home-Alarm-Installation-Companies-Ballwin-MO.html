<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.

When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that information when they appear at your home.
