<h3>House Security System Canton CT 06019</h3>
<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the 3rd generation of the well known Dropcam-- one of the very first, and one of the best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up practically anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it interacts with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, along with numerous third-party smart- home devices.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition.

After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send out smart device informs with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
