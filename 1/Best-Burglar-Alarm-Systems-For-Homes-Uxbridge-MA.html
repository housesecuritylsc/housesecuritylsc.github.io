<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was created for homeowners. It should be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, as soon as set up, is difficult to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for big properties and are often more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide array of equipment and home automation items at an affordable price, the one area where the company especially stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
