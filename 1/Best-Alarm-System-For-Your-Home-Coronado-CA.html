Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

When you're feeling old-fashioned, you can control Vivint security with a keychain remote, a mobile app or the primary control panel.</p>
