<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users ought to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events.

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current suggestion.</p>
