<p>The very best home security systems have professional monitoring. We know it's an additional expense every month, but we often suggest it. At $199 for the basic five-piece package, the Ring Alarm is one of the most inexpensive security systems on the marketplace. Although there's no alternative for professional installation, not just does Ring make things as easy as possible, this is simply another cost you do not have to fret about.</p>
