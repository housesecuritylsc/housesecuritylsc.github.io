<p>Even worse yet, motion sensing units produce the best variety of incorrect alarms, specifically if you have pets. Due to the fact that family pet safe" motion sensing units can still false alarm if your canine or cat jumps into the protected area or puts on some weight. Utilize them sparingly and ensure you follow placement instructions to the letter.</p>
