<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All objects emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by an item is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it discharges.

The gadget collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon information about the temperature differences.

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, etc.), I wish to make certain that they all easily interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
