<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
