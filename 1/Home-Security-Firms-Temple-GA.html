<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
