<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software. The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular individual comes to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a clever smoke detector and siren later this year, which makes this an even much better proposition.</p>
<p>Informs: Home security cameras press notices to your smartphone when they identify events. Without watching the live feed all the time, this is the only way to keep tabs on your home in relative actual time. Depending upon the camera, it may send text informs when it discovers motion, noise, a face (recognized or unacknowledged), or all three. Some can send alerts to several individuals, usually anyone else in the household using that item's app; others will send emails in addition to text messages as a failsafe in the event you can't access your mobile phone. </p>
