We initially discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
