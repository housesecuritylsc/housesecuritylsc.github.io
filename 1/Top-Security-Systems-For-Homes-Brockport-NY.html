<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather.

All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
