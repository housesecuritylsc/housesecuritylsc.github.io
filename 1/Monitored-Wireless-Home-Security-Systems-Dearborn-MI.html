<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very typical type of two piece sensing unit that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or usually closed when under the influence of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to distance to the 2nd piece which consists of a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether or not the style is typically open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electric existing (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to identify a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensing units are very common and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can generally be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
