<p>The Nest Webcam Indoor is the third generation of the popular Dropcam-- one of the very first, and among the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be installed practically anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it communicates with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, as well as numerous third-party smart- home devices. However to actually utilize the camera's features, you'll have to shell out $10 or more monthly for the Nest Aware program, which provides you access to cloud storage, person detection and customizable activity zones.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year agreement, however given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So select what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the agreement and reap those cost savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years. However if you might update to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
<p>Outdoor security cameras are normally more pricey than their indoor counterparts. They can vary in cost from around $100 as much as $400 depending upon functions.
