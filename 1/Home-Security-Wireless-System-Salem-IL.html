<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
