<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a lots of other wise home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of clever home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely outstanding, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>

We like that you can choose from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every clever camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
