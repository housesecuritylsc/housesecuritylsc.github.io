<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited variety of sensors. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather.

All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
