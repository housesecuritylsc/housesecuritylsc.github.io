<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering benefit, assurance and fulfillment to every customer and are dedicated to satisfying our customer's needs with integrity, sincerity, interest and exceptional service. Almost all of the current DIY and high-end home security systems provide support for voice control via Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and sometimes Apple Siri, which permits you to unlock doors, change thermostat settings, open the garage, and arm or deactivate your system with a spoken command to a linked gadget like an Amazon Echo or a Google Home speaker. Lots of also offer assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That) applets, which use triggers from IFTTT-compatible web services and gadgets to develop an action. For example, you can produce an applet that says if a garage door is opened to switch on the floodlight.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, featured long and usually onerous contracts, and often rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they use little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've examined individually and do not recommend for many people.</p>

<p>Equipment Cost - With some companies, like SimpliSafe, you spend for all the equipment upfront. You can start for about $200 or less for essential equipment, and paid monitoring isn't required.

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it look like you're home - and you'll also get an alert if your Echo speakers hear the sound of an alarm, or broken glass.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to opt for a Do It Yourself system or choose an expertly set up system, you'll need to pay a month-to-month or yearly  cost if you need monitoring, and in many cases, you'll be struck with a month-to-month fee to settle the cost of hardware components. With most Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly costs if you choose to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. If you devote to a three-year contract, the price of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus plan goes for $10 monthly and doesn't require an agreement.</p>
