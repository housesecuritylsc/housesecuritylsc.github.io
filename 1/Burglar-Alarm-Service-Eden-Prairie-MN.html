<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If catching footage in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
