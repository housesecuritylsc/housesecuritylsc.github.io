<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you precisely reroute the field of vision without remounting the security camera every time. They're terrific for warehouses.

In fact, we do not advise purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership.
