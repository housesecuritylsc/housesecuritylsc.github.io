<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do experience a home intrusion emergency. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm must suffice to frighten trespassers in many cases. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to require cops response.</p>
