<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed understanding of all the needed systems is essential. If there are no as-built files providing functionality and setup information to make this combination work, there are only 2 alternatives. The first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is not available or reluctant to supply those information) and record the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
