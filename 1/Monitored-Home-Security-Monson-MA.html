<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
