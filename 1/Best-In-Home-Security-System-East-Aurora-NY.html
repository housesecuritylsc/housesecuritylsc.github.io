<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and federal government facilities, and residential clients. Non-traditional networks such as personal network Bluetooth devices are not safe from hacking and should be considered as a security danger.

The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers call into question the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
