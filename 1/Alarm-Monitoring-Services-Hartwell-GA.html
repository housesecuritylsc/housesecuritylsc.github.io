<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
