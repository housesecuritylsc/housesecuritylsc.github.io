<h2>Wired Or Wireless Video Surveillance, What's The Difference Mccordsville</h2>
<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of up to one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have actually noticed some improvements considering that the camera's launch, and will continue to test and upgrade this evaluation, as required.</p>

<p>We like all the features the Kasa Area provides that make it such outstanding value and one of the best security cameras on the market: two-way audio, night vision, 1080p HD recording, custom activity zones and more. The camera can tape video in up to 1080p, which looks completely great on a smart device screen and will not tax your internet connection excessive.
