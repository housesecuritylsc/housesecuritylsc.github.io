Usually, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is lots of available light, and when the lighting becomes low or absent (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Because they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and catch outstanding low light video, commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins.</p>

<p>Smart alarms are just as efficient as conventional burglar alarms but they don't always have an external siren that sits on the front of the house, which can serve as a deterrent to robbers.
