Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
