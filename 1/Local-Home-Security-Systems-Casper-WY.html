<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really irritating. Again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because apparently they vehicle renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too costly, and not great.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter package". So it's pretty much expected that it will not have extended customizability or a wide variety of features. However, I am still disappointed that they have not included a minimum of a basic camera with this kit. Cameras are quite standard for self monitored alarm systems, especially since incorrect alarms is a really real possibility.</p>

<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over two months.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that 1080p is generally the standard resolution for cameras we've tested, there are benefits to designs with higher-resolution sensors. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however practically all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
<p>When integrated with face acknowledgment, surveillance camera networks raise extra privacy and civil liberties issues-- particularly due to the fact that face acknowledgment information is prone to error.
