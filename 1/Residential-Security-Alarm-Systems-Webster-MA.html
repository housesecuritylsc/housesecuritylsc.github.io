Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
