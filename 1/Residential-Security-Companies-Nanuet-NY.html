<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
