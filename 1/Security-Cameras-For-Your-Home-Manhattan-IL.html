<p>Nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your residential or commercial property and possessions. On the occasion that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are waiting to respond by instantaneously contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Cameras typically broadcast footage over the Internet, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location. Sometimes, surveillance systems are paid for and run by the cities themselves. But in other cases, services and homeowners share surveillance camera footage with police officers.
