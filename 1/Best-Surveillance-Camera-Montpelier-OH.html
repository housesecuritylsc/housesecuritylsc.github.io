Alternately, if you do not have a home automation center, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that features its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize standard pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install. Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others require that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
