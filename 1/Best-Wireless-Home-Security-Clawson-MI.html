<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Paying for the equipment in advance provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>
