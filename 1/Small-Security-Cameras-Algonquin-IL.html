<p>Remote Areas - If a location around your business is secluded, chances are unsavory characters are going to pick up on that, making these spots popular for preparing and carrying out theft. One typical area is near a dumpster-an employee may throw away the stolen products just to recover them later on or send an accomplice for the retrieval. Security cameras present near a dumpster can hinder this activity.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
