<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole household will love. But for everybody who enjoys ADT, it looks like there's someone who's had a terrible experience. Because ADT has more clients than the majority of brand names-- which indicates it has more opportunities to run into issues, part of that is. However part of it is the way ADT offers its equipment. When a company works with multiple dealerships and service providers, its consumers are going to get a broad variety of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems usually do not included upfront charges. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts!

<p>If you do experience a home invasion emergency situation, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to frighten burglars in many cases.
