These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Paying for the equipment in advance offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
