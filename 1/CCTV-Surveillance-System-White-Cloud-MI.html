<p>While the wireless home security systems are an excellent option, you have to consider what's right for you and your home.

Wired security systems are also susceptible to power failures. Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of an outage, but long term interruptions will lead to the system losing power.

Since these security systems are incorporated into the home's electrical wiring, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>

<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular person gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99).
