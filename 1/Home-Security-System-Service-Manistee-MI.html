<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

If you want to prevent needing to sign an agreement, we would recommend thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system rather.</p>
