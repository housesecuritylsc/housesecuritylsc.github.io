<p>The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring alternative, something that's unheard of among professionally set up systems.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If capturing footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
