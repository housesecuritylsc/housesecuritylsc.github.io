<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>Security cameras are meant to be discreet gadgets. Some have protective dome lenses and others have night vision technology. Some individuals choose a whole surveillance and security system, which is normally comprised of multiple cameras for indoor and outdoor use and a multi-channel DVR base for taping video. These elements send live footage to your smart device, pc, or tablet so you can check in anytime while on the go. We also carry related accessories, such as cable televisions, extension cables, and microphones to complement your security and surveillance experience. </p>
