<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not believe that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
