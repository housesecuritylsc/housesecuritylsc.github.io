<p>We liked Alder for their fast response times and total adaptability. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was pretty darn and effortless streamlined. Otherwise, this company provides a similar feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is available today, it's safe to state that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not better, than the wired systems. Provided all of the other benefits, it's simple to see why so many people are picking this alternative. </p>
