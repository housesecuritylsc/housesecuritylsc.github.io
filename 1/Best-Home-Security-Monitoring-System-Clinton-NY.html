<p>Several other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
