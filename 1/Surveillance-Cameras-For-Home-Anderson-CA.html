<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
