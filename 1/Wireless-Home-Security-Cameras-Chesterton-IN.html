<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software application. The latter enables you to see specifically when a particular individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to launch a smart smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even much better proposition.</p>

The sound might terrify off prospective burglars-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. But the police will not come up until you personally call them. </p>
