<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
