<h3>House Security Alarm System Missoula MT 59801</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
