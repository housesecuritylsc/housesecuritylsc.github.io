<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered intruders or wild animals.

Provided all of the other benefits, it's simple to see why a lot of people are picking this alternative. </p>
