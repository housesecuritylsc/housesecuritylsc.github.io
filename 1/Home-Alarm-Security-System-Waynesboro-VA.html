HD motion sensing units will notify you when somebody presses your Video Doorbell, when motion is recorded or when an undesirable visitor does not press the doorbell.

When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smart device notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
