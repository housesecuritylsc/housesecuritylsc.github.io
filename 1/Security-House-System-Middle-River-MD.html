<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If catching video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

These companies developed their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for consumers. Alexa support is included, as you would get out of an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera effectively deals with all the normal functions when it pertains to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is consisted of too, for when the lights head out. </p>
