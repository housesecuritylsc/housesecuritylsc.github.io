<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
