There are two components at play in an alarm reaction: the monitoring center's action time and your local police department's.

<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, informs, and combination all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
