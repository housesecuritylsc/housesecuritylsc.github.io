<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>

Without enjoying the live feed throughout the day, this is the only way to keep tabs on your home in relative real time.

Some can send notifies to multiple people, usually anyone else in the household using that item's app; others will send e-mails in addition to text as a failsafe in case you can't access your mobile phone. </p>
