When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
