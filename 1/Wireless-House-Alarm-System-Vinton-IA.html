However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

In spite of that, the alarm ought to suffice to scare away trespassers most of the times.
