<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly innovative, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment.
