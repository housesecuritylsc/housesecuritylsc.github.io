<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
