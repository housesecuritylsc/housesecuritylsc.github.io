We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

The latter enables you to see specifically when a specific individual gets to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.
