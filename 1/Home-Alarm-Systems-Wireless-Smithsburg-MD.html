The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this alarm is a starter kit". So it's pretty much expected that it won't have extended customizability or a large range of features. However, I am still disappointed that they haven't consisted of at least a basic camera with this kit. Cameras are pretty basic for self monitored alarm, particularly due to the fact that incorrect alarms is a very real possibility.</p>
