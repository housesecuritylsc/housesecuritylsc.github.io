We initially saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
