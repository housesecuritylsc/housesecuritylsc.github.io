During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather simple to set up and use-- however not rather as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm. Get home security and clever home automation without all the agreements and monthly fees.</p>

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
