<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>Another location where Arlo excels is customer service. After long-term testing this camera given that we first made it a choice in 2016, we saw that our Arlo Q started forecasting a pink tint, which appears to be an ongoing problem for some owners. We contacted customer assistance, which provided a free replacement unit-- despite the fact that the service warranty had actually long given that expired.</p>
