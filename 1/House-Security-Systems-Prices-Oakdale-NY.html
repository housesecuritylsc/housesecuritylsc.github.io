At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm should suffice to scare away burglars in many cases. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to necessitate cops response.</p>
