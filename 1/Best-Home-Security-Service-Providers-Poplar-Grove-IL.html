<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.

After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage space, for instance.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation, reliability is a highly subjective matter, depending upon which functions and benefits a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, but low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common complaints. Hardwired systems require very little maintenance, and except a general power outage, are harder to disrupt. Regardless of a general enhancement in wireless innovation, there appear to be less methods for hardwired systems to be disrupted and crippled. </p>
