The infrared energy produced by a things is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of discovering small differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon information about the temperature distinctions.
