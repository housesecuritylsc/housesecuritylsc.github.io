We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
