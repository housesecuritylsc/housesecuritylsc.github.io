Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and calling leading scientists to ask about upcoming evaluations. Both released and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was international in scope.</p>
