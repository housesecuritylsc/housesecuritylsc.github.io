<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home.

We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
