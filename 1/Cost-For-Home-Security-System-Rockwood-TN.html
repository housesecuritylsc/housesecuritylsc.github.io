If a homeowner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms occur.
