<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
