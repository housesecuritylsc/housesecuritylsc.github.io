<p>Motion Detection: If you're concerned about video storage, check to see if the camera offers motion detection.

<p>These cameras do not need a video capture card due to the fact that they work using a digital signal which can be conserved straight to a computer system.

The greatest photo quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
