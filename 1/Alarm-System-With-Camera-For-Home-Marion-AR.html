<p>Home security systems and contemporary smart home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to use their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Commercial residential or commercial properties tend to have even higher false alarm rates than houses since more people tend to share responsibility for activating and shutting off the alarm, and the systems tend to be more complicated.
