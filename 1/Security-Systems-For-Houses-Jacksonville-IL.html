<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the client service experience varies extensively depending on the dealership you opt for. </p>
