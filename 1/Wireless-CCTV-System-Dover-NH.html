<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your home and ownerships. In case your alarm is set off, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are waiting to respond by instantly connecting with you and if requirement be, the local medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>The other major decision when choosing a home security camera is whether you need an outdoor or indoor camera. Outdoor cameras will often be built to be more long lasting and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp. The downside of outdoor cameras is that they're typically mains powered and require expert installation. Luckily, I have actually tested out dozens of cameras and condensed everything I've learned into the list below.

Let's dive in.</p>

However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
