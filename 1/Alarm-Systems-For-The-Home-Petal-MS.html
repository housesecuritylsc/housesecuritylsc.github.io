<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system identifies a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it informs the security team and, sometimes, emergency situation responders. Unfortunately, history has shown that surveillance technologies put in place for one purpose undoubtedly expand into other usages. And with video technology most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems must be able to do positions a substantial risk.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
