<p>The Kasa Web Cam Outdoor is a good well-rounded weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. Nevertheless, there are a few tradeoffs with this camera. Unlike other outdoor cameras on this list, the Kasa Webcam needs to be plugged in to an outlet to get power, and while the camera is weather-resistant, the connection in between its cable and power supply is not.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it detects an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the gadget to act as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If catching video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
