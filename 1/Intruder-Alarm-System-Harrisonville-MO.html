The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of night, usage and day images have always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we encountered when checking the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found. We've seen it highlight mice, automobiles, and moths.</p>
