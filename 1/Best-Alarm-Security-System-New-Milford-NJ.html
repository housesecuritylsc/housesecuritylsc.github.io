<h3>Business Security Alarm System in New Milford NJ</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike.
