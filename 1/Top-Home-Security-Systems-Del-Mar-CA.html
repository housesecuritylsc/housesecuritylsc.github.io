<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the contract you need to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, because obviously they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too costly, and not terrific.</p>
