<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
