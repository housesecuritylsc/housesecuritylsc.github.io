<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
