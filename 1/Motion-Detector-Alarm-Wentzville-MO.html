<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
