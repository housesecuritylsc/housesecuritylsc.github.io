<h2>ADT Burglar Alarm With Police Response Fort Gibson</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication.
