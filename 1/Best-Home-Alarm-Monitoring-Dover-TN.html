<h3>Home Security Surveillance Systems in Tennessee</h3>
<p>An on-site ringer will typically set off a bell or siren connected to the structure when the alarm is tripped. Likewise, when an automated dialer alarm is tripped, a telephone call is immediately placed to the police or fire departments, and a pre-recorded statement is played when that call is responded to. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to call 9-1-1.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
