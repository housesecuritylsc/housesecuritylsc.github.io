<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I enjoy the Hive View's design - certainly the most visually pleasing camera on this list.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen often enough.
