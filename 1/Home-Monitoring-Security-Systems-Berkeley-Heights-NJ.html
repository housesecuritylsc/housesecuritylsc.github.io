<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
