<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensing units. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This indicates that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your home is larger than 4,500 square feet.

<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same method as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the same individual could place a surveillance camera then from another location see a person within the personal privacy of their home.

Being able to distinguish between a car and an individual, for instance, permits you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
