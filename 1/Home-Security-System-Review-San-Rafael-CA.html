ADT gives you lots of alternatives. You can lease a system from them or buy monitoring for an existing system. They can monitor equipment made by much of the leading brand names. They support a full spectrum of wireless security features, including video monitoring, home automation, sensing units to avoid an environmental disaster, and medical alerts.
