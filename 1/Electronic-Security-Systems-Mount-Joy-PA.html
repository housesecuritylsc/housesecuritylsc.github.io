<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who truly is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side.

We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
