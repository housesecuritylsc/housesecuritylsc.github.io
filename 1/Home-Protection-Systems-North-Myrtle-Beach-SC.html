Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or numerous, they work with your home's internet network to send video right to your computer or mobile phone. Most consumer cameras save data internally, on a detachable microSD card, or remotely on the cloud.</p>

<p>The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home parts in your house.

Contact sensors are the first thing you should buy along with the base station; these attach to windows and doors and will signal you when they open. Other home security components consist of motion sensors, keypads, key fobs, cameras, glass-break sensing units, and panic buttons.</p>
