<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
