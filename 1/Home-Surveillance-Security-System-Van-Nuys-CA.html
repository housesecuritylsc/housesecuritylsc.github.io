<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
