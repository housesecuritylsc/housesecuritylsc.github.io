<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can activate a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera detects motion or sound. This series of events also works in reverse.

Or, if Arlo Pro spots a sound, you can have your lights set to turn on. Unfortunately, the integration with SmartThings still has bugs and not everything works as it should; however, the capacity is still there.</p>
