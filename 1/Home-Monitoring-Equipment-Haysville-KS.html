<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was developed for house owners. It must be set up by a professional alarm installation group and, when set up, is tough to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for large residential or commercial properties and are frequently more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your house. If you've already set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system, the group will be able to reuse the existing electrical wiring. However, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>

If you are setting up a new alarm, please get in touch with the Authorities Department for an Alarm Authorization Application.
