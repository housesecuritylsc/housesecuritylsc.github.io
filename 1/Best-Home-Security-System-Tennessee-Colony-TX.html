<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software. The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular individual arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).
