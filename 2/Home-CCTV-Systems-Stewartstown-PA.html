<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

I've ditched my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually found trespassers or wild animals.
