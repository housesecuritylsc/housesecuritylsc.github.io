<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very common type of 2 piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or normally closed when under the influence of an electromagnetic field as in the case of proximity to the 2nd piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, once again based on whether or not the design is generally open or usually closed. This action coupled with an electric present (usually at 12V DC) permits an alarm control board to discover a fault on that zone or circuit.
