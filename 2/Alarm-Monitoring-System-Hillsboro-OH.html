<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop.

Being able to distinguish between a car and an individual, for example, permits you to cut down on unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
