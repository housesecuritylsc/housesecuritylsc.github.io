<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup process. This usually includes finding an area for your camera, developing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system.
