<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
