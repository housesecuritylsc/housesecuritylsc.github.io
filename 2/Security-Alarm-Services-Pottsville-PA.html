<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
