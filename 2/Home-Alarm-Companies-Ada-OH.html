<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
