<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
