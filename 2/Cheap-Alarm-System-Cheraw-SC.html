Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>

<p>Several other models were disqualified due to performance issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
