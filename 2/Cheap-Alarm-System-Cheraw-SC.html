Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
