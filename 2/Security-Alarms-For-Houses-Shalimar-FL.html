Throughout screening, we discovered it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was identified. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
