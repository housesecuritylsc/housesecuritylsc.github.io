<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". If you're trying to find a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs. It ships with four smooth and white bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor usage. They're geared up with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and clever IR to supply up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app periodically forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
<p>ADT does not have the strongest customer care reputation among the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 grievances on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this as much as the truth that ADT has numerous million more consumers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations. There's a great deal of talk about wireless cameras, but that term can be confusing. Some makers call a camera wireless" because it utilizes a Wi-Fi connection, and others describe cameras that don't need to be plugged into an outlet.</p>
