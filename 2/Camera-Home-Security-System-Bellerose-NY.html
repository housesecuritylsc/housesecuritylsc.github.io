<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is required. If there are no as-built documents providing performance and configuration information to make this combination work, there are just 2 choices. The very first choice, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is not available or unwilling to offer those details) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
