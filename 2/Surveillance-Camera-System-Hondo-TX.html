The BIBENE Home Security System connects your security and smart devices to enable you to manage them remotely.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
