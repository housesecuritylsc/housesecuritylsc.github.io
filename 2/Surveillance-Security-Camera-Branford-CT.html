We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
