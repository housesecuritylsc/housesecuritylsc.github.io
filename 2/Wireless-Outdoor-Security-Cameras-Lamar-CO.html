<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole neighborhood. The equipment needed for the wired system tends to be a bit cheaper than the wireless systems. While this might seem appealing initially, think of all of the drawbacks to the wired systems that we've already pointed out. Answering the concern Who's at my door this time?" has actually never been much easier. Whether you're home or away, you can examine your home security cameras with the ADT mobile app on your phone.</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual ways of validating if something is in fact incorrect and how major the scenario is.
