<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
