<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
