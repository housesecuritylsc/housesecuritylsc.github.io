<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common.

With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
