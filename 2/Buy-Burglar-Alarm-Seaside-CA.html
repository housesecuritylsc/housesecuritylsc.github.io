<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more costly for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
