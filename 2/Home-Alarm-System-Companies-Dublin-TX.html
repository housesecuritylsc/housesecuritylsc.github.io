<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy choice. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So choose what will be the better deal for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, choose the contract and enjoy those cost savings. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
