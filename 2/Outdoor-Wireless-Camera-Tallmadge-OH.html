Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If recording footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
