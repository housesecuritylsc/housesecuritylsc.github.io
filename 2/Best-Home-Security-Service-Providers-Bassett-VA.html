These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments offer a number of "totally free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>

When the system spots a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it notifies the security team and, in many cases, emergency responders. Regrettably, history has revealed that surveillance innovations put in place for one purpose undoubtedly broaden into other usages. And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear limits for what CCTV systems need to be able to do presents a considerable risk.</p>
