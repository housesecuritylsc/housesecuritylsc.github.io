<p>If you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at, there's no use in having an outdoor security camera.

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the porch by a certified electrician (who takes place to be my husband).

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
