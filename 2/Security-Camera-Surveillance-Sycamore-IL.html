Floodlight camera replaces outdated security lights and connects to standard electrical boxes. When Floodlight Web cam identifies motion, it begins streaming video, shines its lights and sends out notifications to your tablet, pc and phone.

<p>The other major choice when selecting a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will frequently be developed to be more resilient and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp.

And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
