<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to overlook items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
