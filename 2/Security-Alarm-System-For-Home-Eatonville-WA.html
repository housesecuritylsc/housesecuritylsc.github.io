<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year agreement, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So choose what will be the better deal for you. Go with the agreement and enjoy those savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years.

However, you might select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the client. </p>
