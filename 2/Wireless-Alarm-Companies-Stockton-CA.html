There are only two options if there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration info to make this combination work. The first alternative, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is unwilling or unavailable to offer those information) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and change, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system discovers a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it informs the security team and, in some cases, emergency situation responders.

And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear borders for what CCTV systems ought to be able to do postures a significant risk.</p>
