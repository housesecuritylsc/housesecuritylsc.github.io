Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
