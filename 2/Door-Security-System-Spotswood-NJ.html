<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has discovered burglars or wild animals.

It can compare general motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing period).
