Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
