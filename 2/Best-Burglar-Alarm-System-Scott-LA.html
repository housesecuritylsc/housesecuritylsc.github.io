<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Screens can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

<p>Since it's more complicated than it needs to be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

This form of wireless communication works the exact same method as your cellphone and depends on a cellular signal.
