The primary difference is that the wired system couple with the other wise home gadgets to develop a network of home security around your home. It can be managed from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control panel (also referred to as the alarm panel).

<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously restricts your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party smart home devices like lights, outlets, locks, and thermostats.
