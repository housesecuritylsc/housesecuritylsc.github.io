It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment prices is super reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge.

<p>Professional installation was virtually the only way to put in a home security system 15 years back.
