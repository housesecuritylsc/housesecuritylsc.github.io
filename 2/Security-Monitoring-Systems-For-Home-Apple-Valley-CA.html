<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically much safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not connect. A help window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative assisted her troubleshoot the connection.
