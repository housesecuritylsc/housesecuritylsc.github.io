<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing benefit, assurance and satisfaction to every client and are devoted to fulfilling our consumer's requirements with stability, honesty, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Dependability has long been at the heart of the debate over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's frequently skewed by factors such as uncertainty over the vulnerability of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms. While enhancements over the last few years have actually made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that don't impact hardwired systems.</p>
