And that's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>The Netatmo Existence includes IFTTT, Google, and HomeKit support, and has the capability to differentiate between cars and trucks, people, and animals. It also uses a great deal of complimentary storage possibilities by means of the consisted of 8 GB microSD card, a totally free Dropbox account, or any individual FTP server.
