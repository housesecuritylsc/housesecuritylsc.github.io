<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

The highest photo quality of DVD is only somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
