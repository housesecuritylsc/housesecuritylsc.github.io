<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
