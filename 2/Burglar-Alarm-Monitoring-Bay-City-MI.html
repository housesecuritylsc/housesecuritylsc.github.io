After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
