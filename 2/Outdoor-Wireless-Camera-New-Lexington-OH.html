<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
