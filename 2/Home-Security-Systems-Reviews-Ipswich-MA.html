<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assaulter, because the interruption of the network avoids the flow of data and in fact indirectly protects data by preventing it from being sent. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive assailant to tape-record these codes and utilize various cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system.

Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect items that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.
