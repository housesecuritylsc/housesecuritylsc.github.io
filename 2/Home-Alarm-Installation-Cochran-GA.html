<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
