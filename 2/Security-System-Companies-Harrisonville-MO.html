<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
