<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole household will love. Professional installation with expert monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT professionally install and monitor your system-- you don't have to raise a finger or babysit informs. Over my 25 plus year profession in the security industry, I have actually researched, offered, set up, and because we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, watched alarm signals for more hours than I want to confess.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
