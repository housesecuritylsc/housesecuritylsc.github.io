<h3>Home Alarm Security System in Virginia</h3>
<p>A little more pricey than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as easy to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensing units had been activated.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
