Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, due to the fact that obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.
