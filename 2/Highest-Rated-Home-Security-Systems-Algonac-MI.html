<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face acknowledgment software. The latter enables you to see exactly when a specific person gets to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a wise smoke detector and siren later this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can choose whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station.

However, you may select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the consumer. </p>
