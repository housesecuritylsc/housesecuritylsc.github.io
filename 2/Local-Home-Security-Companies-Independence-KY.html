Commercial cameras outperform their cheaper cousins because they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture excellent low light video.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months.</p>
