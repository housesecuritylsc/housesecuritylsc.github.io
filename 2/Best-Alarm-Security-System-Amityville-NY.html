<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even set off incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they occur frequently enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
