<h3>Alarm Monitoring System Lake Oswego OR 97035</h3>
<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so crucial?  For starters, Deep Knowing permits someone to discover what they are trying to find without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Picture a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are trying to find in the recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police car appears.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is the one of the very best tools for watching over your home. Its wire-free design, high-resolution video, and affordable cloud monitoring help it stand above the competitors. Still, it is among the most expensive security cameras you can buy, so we believe the Wyze Cam Pan is a good option if you're intending to save some dough.

Few companies have a broader series of equipment or larger security network readily available. </p>
