<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.

<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
