Depending upon distance and building and construction materials, one or more wireless repeaters may be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be transferred to a new home easily, a benefit for those who rent or who move regularly. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm secures against a burglar cutting a cable television or from failures of a web provider. This complete wireless setup is typically described as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>Security Camera Surveillance: You can pick to add a video camera and monitor to your system so you can capture burglars in the act if they do pick to break into your home.

It also suggests that if you in fact saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might quickly record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you imagine, would be enough to send out even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
