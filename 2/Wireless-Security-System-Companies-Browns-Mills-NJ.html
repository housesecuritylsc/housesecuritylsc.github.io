<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
