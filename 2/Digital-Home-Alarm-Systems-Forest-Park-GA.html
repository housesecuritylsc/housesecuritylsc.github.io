<p>Self-monitored systems, like many security systems, are sold online and are usually offered in packages.

A lot of companies offer house owners the capability to add additional parts like another camera, contact sensing units, a panic button, keypad, smoke alarm, carbon monoxide detectors, or a crucial fob.</p>
<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Many insurer offer discount rates on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments offer a number of "totally free" false alarms prior to imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies cast doubt on the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>

Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensing units or groups.  High-end systems allow multiple gain access to codes, and might even permit them to be utilized just when, or on specific days, or just in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center must organize an oral code to be supplied by an authorized person in case of incorrect alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm reaction is unneeded.
