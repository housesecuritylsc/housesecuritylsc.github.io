<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to find what they are looking for without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Imagine a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we simply type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have a powerful service for collecting and capturing criminals evidence.</p>

Provided benefits like that and the more direct capabilities of monitoring and securing your home, it may be the correct time to update your security.</p>
