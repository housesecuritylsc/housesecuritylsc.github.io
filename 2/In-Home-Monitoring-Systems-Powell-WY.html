<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.

Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
