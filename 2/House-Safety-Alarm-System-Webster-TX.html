<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
