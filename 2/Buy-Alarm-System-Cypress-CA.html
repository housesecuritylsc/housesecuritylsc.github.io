<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even trigger false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough.
