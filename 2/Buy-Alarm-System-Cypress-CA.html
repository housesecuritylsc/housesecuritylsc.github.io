(A four-camera pack expenses $504.72 at the time of writing.) However we can't fault Arlo excessive for that-- any premium multi-camera system is going to hit your wallet hard.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even trigger false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
