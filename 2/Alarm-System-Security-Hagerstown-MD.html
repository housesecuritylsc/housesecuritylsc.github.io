This creates a one in 3 opportunity of catching a particular incident on video (either live or taped).

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
