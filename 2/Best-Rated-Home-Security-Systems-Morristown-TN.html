<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing.

If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
