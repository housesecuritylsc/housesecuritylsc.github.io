<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
