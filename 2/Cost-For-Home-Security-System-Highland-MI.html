<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the minimal variety of sensing units. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet.

Nevertheless, this is typically a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend upon how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
