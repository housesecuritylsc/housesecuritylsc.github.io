The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost two years of use, day and night images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion identified. We have actually seen it highlight moths, cars, and mice.</p>
