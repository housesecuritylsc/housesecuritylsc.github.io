<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the agreement you need to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Really annoying. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially cutting-edge, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So pick what will be the better deal for you. If you know you'll sit tight for at least 3 years, opt for the agreement and reap those cost savings.
