<h3>Wireless Security System Companies in Independence LA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.
