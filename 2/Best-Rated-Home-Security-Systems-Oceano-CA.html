<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to choose a Do It Yourself system or choose a professionally installed system, you'll need to pay a yearly or month-to-month charge if you need monitoring, and in many cases, you'll be struck with a regular monthly cost to pay off the cost of hardware elements.

If you add monitoring, costs will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month.
