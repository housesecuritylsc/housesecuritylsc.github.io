In 2007, I contracted with ADT to install a home security system and regular monthly theft and fire monitoring. The overall installation charge alone was not cheap-- numerous thousand dollars.</p>

We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.
