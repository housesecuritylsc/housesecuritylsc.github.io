<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
