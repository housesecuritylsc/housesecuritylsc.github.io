Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
