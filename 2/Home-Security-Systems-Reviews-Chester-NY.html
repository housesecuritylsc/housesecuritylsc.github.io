<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out smartphone notifies with that info when they show up at your home.
