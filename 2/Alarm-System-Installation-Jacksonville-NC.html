<p>Think about it this way, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars?

<p>Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the capability to also hear what's going on offers you a more total picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away.

We develop HD CCTV systems for brand name new purchases. A1 Security Cameras has a team of expert specialists here with years of hands on experience. When we imply "hands on experience", we suggest climbing up the ladder, running cable televisions, testing security cameras of all sorts and the whole 9 lawns that you will need to do to install security camera systems.
