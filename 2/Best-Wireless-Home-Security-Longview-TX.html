<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even activate false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen frequently enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
