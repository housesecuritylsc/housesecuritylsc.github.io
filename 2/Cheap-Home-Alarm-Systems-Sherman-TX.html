Today, we're transforming the wise home. Firsts like Blue are what we do. Because they're so certainly recognizable as a security camera, they're a fantastic deterrent as well, and they're simple to install almost anywhere. With the typical weatherproof hoods, they're quite resilient, but they do not constantly come with the complete IP accreditation of other models.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
