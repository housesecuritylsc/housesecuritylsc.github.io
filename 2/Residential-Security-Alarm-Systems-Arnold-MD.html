<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).
