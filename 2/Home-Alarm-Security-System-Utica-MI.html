Screens can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>The density of gain access to points can even be a problem - there are a restricted variety of channels available, and they partially overlap. Each channel can manage several networks, but places with numerous personal wireless networks (for example, apartment complexes), the limited variety of Wi-Fi radio channels might trigger slowness and other problems.</p>
