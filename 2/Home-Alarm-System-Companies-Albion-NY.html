The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have actually a cable connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit easier to mess up for prospective trespassers. Certainly among the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
