<h3>Home Security Camera Reviews in California</h3>
<p>The second important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably ear-piercing inbuilt alarm, so it functions as a home alarm system along with a security camera.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment.

Alexa support is consisted of, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera competently handles all the normal functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
