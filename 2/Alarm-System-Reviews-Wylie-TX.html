<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems normally don't featured upfront costs. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
