<p>Although it has a great deal of flexibility in placement, the Nest Camera Outdoor does need a power source, so it should be positioned within reach of an outlet.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
