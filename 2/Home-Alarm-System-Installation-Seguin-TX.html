Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
