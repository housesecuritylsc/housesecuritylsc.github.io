<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.
