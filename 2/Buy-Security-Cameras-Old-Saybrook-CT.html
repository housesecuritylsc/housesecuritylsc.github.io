This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
