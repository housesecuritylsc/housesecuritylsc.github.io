<p>On the surface, these 2 camera classifications may appear similar, though if you were able to see inside, the differences become obvious and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not.

That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, since you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure. It isn't really clever. Wireless devices interact more securely and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>

Since pet safe" motion sensing units can still incorrect alarm if your pet dog or cat jumps into the safeguarded location or puts on some weight.
