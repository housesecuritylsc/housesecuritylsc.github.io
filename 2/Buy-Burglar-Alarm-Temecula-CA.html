<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras.
