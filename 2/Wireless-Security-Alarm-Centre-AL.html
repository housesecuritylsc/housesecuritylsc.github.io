Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>

<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires.
