<h3>Best Rated Home Security Systems in Texas</h3>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Equipment consists of things like your door and window sensors, motion sensors, control panel, etc. The cost completely depends upon which provider you choose, however anticipate to pay a few hundred dollars for a basic plan--$ 200 would be thought about cheap for a starter pack of home security equipment. That said, it can run less expensive if you opt for a company that runs a lot of deals on equipment (like Frontpoint). </p>
