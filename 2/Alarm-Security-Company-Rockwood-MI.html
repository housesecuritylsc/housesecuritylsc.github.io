<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a detailed knowledge of all the required systems is required. If there are no as-built documents providing functionality and configuration details to make this combination work, there are only two options. The first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unwilling or unavailable to provide those information) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and change, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
