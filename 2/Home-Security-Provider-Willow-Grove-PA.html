<p>The Douglas County Burglar Alarm Regulation offers a fair option to a difficult issue: managing our law enforcement properties to provide exceptional law enforcement services. With standard clever home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for would-be plan thieves or talk to visitors who stop by.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common.

With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
