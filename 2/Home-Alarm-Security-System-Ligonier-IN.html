<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features.
