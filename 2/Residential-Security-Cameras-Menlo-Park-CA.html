With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
