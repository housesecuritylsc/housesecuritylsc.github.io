<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the typical motion notifies, and a 90+ dB alarm that is most likely to scare off any approaching burglar before they've got too far into your home. When you're at home and don't want to be tape-recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>Today you can get 20% off your SimpliSafe equipment plan when you choose the Interactive Monitoring strategy at checkout. That's nearly $100 off the most costly plan, The Haven-- putting it at just under $400 overall.

<p>The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either indoors or outside, and includes a convenient installing bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records benefits the cost, and best of all, it features totally free cloud storage (approximately two hours in overall). Since Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app also has a connection to Ring's Next-door neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other incidents in your community, and post videos from your Blink camera. Blink's app is fairly robust, and while it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of Arlo's cameras, this sub-$ 100 has a lot of features for the rate.</p>

<p>Your location and potential threats will determine whether hidden or visible cameras are right for you. You may want to hide them if you're concerned about your cameras being disabled. A combination of both can typically be a good strategy, too. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
