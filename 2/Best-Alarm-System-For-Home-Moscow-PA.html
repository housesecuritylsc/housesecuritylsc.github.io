<p>The Residence Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some people. Home has actually updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better range for sensors. Both the original Residence system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only design we checked that likewise deals with HomeKit.

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I simply had issues.
