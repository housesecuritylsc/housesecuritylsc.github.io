Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I wish to make certain that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is required for transferring video footage from the CCTV security cameras.
